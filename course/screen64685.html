		<h1>Treating minor burns </h1>
		<p>It is important that you do not cool the burn with very cold water or ice, as the extreme cold could cause more damage.</p>
		<h1>Cool the burn</h1>
		<p>Cooling should always be the immediate course of action for a minor burn. Of course, you may not always have access to cool running water which would allow the burn to be cooled for a minimum of ten minutes. If you only have a small amount of water in a bottle, for example, you could cover the burn in a clean wet cloth, or if there is no water immediately at hand, another cool clean fluid could be used, such as a soft drink. In this situation, you should always look for cool water immediately, but you may need to be a little more creative until water becomes available. </p>
