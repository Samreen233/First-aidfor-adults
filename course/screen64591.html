      <h3>Overview of the recovery position</h3>
      <p>
        In this module, we’ll learn how to put an adult into the recovery position when they are unresponsive but still
        breathing normally.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The recovery position is the safest course of action to take when an injured person is unresponsive but
          still breathing normally.</li>
        <li>A person is unresponsive if they do not respond or react after you call their name and gently shake their
          shoulders. </li>
        <li>If your initial assessment indicates that they may have severe injuries (for example, as a result of falling
          from a significant height or being hit by a car) you should keep the injured person in the position that they
          were found, if it is safe to do so.</li>
        <li>If you are unsure of the extent of the injuries, but suspect that they may be severe (e.g. broken bones), do
          not move them, ensure that they are breathing normally and call for medical help</li>
      </ul>
