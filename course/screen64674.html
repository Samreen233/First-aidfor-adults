			<h2>Unresponsive person in the car</h2>
			<p>
				Keep the following points in mind when providing first aid at the scene of a road accident:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Try to help without actually entering into the crashed car. It could dangerous for you and the
					injured person. It is not uncommon that airbags are set off by someone climbing into a crashed car,
					which can cause further harm to both the first aider and the injured person. Only enter a vehicle if
					you cannot get access to the injured person to check their breathing or stop a bleed, for example.
					Be very cautious for everyone’s safety</li>
				<li>Carefully lean into the vehicle through the door or window nearest to the injured person and
					position yourself beside their head</li>
				<li>Check if they are responsive by asking the casualty simple questions in a loud and clear voice </li>
				<li>If the casualty does not respond, call for help and clear the airway. We will learn how to do so in
					the next section. </li>
