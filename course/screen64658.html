			<h2>Aftercare</h2>

			<p>Make sure to assess the injured person for other injures. Bleeding usually indicates obvious injury,
				however, it is important not to miss other injuries that may be less visible. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the bleeding does not stop or there is an object in the wound, seek medical help</li>
				<li>Provided that the wound is only minor and the bleeding stops, the wound can be cleaned, sterilized
					and covered with a sterile plaster (band-aid) or gauze to aid healing and minimize the risk of
					infection.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember, by building up your knowledge and developing your confidence in delivering first aid, you can
				use appropriate techniques in any given situation. Try to stay calm and perform the skills step by step
				to best help the person that needs first aid.</p>
