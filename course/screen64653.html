			<h2>Key points on stroke</h2>
			<p>
				Make sure that you can recognize the signs of a stroke. The faster that you can recognize the symptoms,
				the more quickly you can help the person get treatment.

				Remember, use the technique FAST to recognize the signs and act appropriately.
			</p>
			<p>t is also useful to record the estimated time at which the person started displaying symptoms to share
				with medical services.

				Whilst waiting for medical help, make sure that you regularly check their breathing and whether they are
				responsive - don’t forget the key lessons we covered earlier in this week.

				Make sure that the person is comfortable and ensure that they do not eat or drink as this could cause
				further complications.</p>
