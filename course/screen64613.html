      You continue to cycle between giving 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths.
      After a short time, the emergency services arrive and take over.
      Thankfully, they are able to restart the man's heart and he is back to breathing normally again.
      The medical staff congratulate you on your actions that have just saved that man's life.

    <p><strong>What could you have done differently if you were in the same position again?</strong></p>
