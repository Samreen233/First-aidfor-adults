			<h2>Clearing the airway</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Place one hand at the back of the neck and slide the other hand under the person’s chin</li>
				<li>Bring the head into a neutral position, in line with the trunk by pulling gently upwards. This
					gentle pulling relieves the cervical column of the weight of the casualty’s head. This opens the
					airway. Check to see if they’re breathing by listening, feeling, and looking for breaths as learned
					in the ABCs of first aid</li>
				<li>Keep this position until emergency services arrives. If the person is responsive, try to keep them
					calm and reassure them that help is on the way. Encourage them to remain in that position if it is
					safe to do so, especially as they may have serious neck, head or spinal injuries</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If the person is unresponsive, not breathing, and for whatever reason they also cannot be removed from
				the car safely to give CPR, you should keep their airway open, try to give mouth to mouth resuscitation
				if you are able to do so, and call for help.</p>
