        <h4>Providing CPR in the context of COVID-19
        </h4>
        <p>Whenever CPR is carried out, particularly on an unknown casualty, there is risk of infection. This is a
          particular risk when providing rescue breaths. When cardiac arrest occurs in the context of an infectious
          disease outbreak protective measures must be taken by the first aider. Remember, the first thing to do is to
          call for help.</p>
        <p>Follow the steps outlined below: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wear a mask if possible. </li>
          <li>After lying the casualty on their back, do not tilt their head back or open their airway. Do not attempt
            to open their mouth.</li>
          <li>Do not lean over the casualty’s face. Do not put your ear or cheek on or near the casualty’s mouth or
            nose.</li>
          <li>Verify that the casualty is breathing by checking if their stomach and chest rise and fall.</li>
          <li>In the absence of normal breathing, or if you are unsure, alert emergency services immediately. If COVID
            19 is suspected, inform them.</li>
          <li>Start chest compressions immediately. If possible, place a tissue, a towel or a mask over the mouth and
            nose of the casualty before proceeding with chest compressions. Use hands only for CPR in order to reduce
            the risk of the virus being spread in the air (aerosolization). </li>
          <li>If available, use an automatic external defibrillator (AED) as soon as possible. Stand at the casualty’s
            feet when administering the shock and follow the instructions given on the device and by the emergency
            services.
          </li>
          <li>Do not perform mouth to mouth resuscitation unless the first aider lives in the same household as the
            casualty (as then the first aider shares the same risk of contamination/ risk is limited within the family).
          </li>
          <li>You should wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water both BEFORE and AFTER performing
            compression-only CPR. If there is no access to running water, an alcohol-based hand gel or ash can be used
            as an alternative.</li>
        </ul>
