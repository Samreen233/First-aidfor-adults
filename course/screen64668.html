			<h3>First aid in the case of road traffic accidents</h3>
			<p>Road traffic accidents are a regular occurrence around the world. First aiders at the scene of a road
				accident can be invaluable. In this module, we will learn some of the key skills required to provide
				effective first aid in the case of a road accident.

				The World Health Organization has estimated that road accidents are responsible for 1.25 million road
				traffic deaths and 50 million injuries each year. It is also the number one cause of death among those
				aged 15-29. As with all the topics we’ve covered in this course, prevention is key. Always ensure that
				you are wearing your seat belt and abiding by the speed limit. If you are a cyclist or motorcyclist,
				ensure that you are clearly visible - wear reflective clothing and a helmet at all times on the road.
