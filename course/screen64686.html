    <h1>Burn aftercare</h1>
    <p>For the majority of minor burns, aftercare can be as simple as covering the burn with a dressing. However, in some situations, a minor burn may turn out to be more serious and you should seek medical attention. If a person is showing any of the following signs, you should seek help:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Burns are on the face, ears, hands, feet, limbs, genitals or joints</li>
      <li>Burns are in the mouth or near the airway such as the neck or chest</li>
      <li>The burn is larger than the size of the person's hand</li>
      <li>The burn is starting to blister - it is vital that you do not burst the blister</li>
      <li>The burn has any fabric or material sticking to the burned area. Again, it is very important that you do not try to remove any foreign objects attached to the skin</li>
    </ul>
