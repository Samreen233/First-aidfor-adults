		<h1>Key points on road traffic accidents</h1>
		<p>Road accidents are challenging situations as injuries can range from life-threatening to relatively minor.
			Nevertheless, the presence of a first aider with even basic knowledge can make a positive difference.</p>
		<p>The scene of a road accident can be a dangerous for those involved in the accident and for those who come to
			their aid. Make sure that you use your key principles of first aid to assess the situation and act
			appropriately. Always maintain your personal safety and do not do anything that could potentially cause harm
			to yourself or those around you.

			Call for help immediately if the accident is serious and people require medical help. If you are able, and
			it is safe to do so, provide first aid to those injured. You may need to use the first aid techniques
			learned in previous modules, such as first aid for bleeding.

			If someone is injured and remains in the vehicle, check that they’re breathing and keep their airway clear
			until help arrives. </p>
