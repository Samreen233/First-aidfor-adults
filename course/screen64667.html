			<h3>COVID-19 and bleeding</h3>
			<p>
				When providing first aid for bleeding, wounds, or abrasions, no changes need to be made in the context
				of COVID-19. This also applies to the treatment of minor burns, which we cover in Module 7. Remember,
				COVID-19 is not transmitted through skin or blood.
				If the person you are treating has a known or suspected infectious disease, follow the protective
				measures described in lesson 1 and monitor the causality while waiting for relief or medical advice.
				<br>
				Encourage the causality to provide first aid on themselves. If they are unable to, the first aider
				should provide first aid, wearing gloves or using another barrier, such as plastic bags.
				<br>
				For severe bleeding, you can show the causality (or their family member, if present) how to apply a
				compression dressing by demonstrating on your own thigh or leg, so that you can maintain appropriate
				distancing. Call emergency services immediately.
