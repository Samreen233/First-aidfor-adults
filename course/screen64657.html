			<h2>Complications associated with bleeding </h2>
			<p>Sometimes, there are additional concerns when a person is bleeding. Many of these are unlikely to happen,
				but being prepared for any issue is important for all first aiders.

				Consider the following: </p>
			<ul>

				<li>An immediate complication associated with bleeding is shock. Signs of shock in an adult can include
					paleness, cold and clammy skin, confusion, difficulty breathing and, in very extreme circumstances,
					the person could become unresponsive. Help the person to lay down and call for medical help
					immediately if you see any of these signs.</li>
				<li>The injured person may be distressed, fearful, and/or in pain in a situation where they have
					experienced an injury and are bleeding. Help them to calm down by reassuring them and explain what
					you’re doing. We'll learn how to deliver psychological first aid in a later module.</li>
			</ul>
