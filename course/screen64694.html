    <h1>Key points on minor burns</h1>
    <p>The key word to remember when dealing with burns is cooling. If someone burns themselves, act fast and cool the area as quickly as possible.</p>
   <h3>Prevention is the greatest cure </h3>
   <p>Remember, prevention is key. The kitchen is an especially high risk place for burns, but this risk can be  reduced by taking  simple preventative steps. Be especially careful when cooking with hot liquids.  Always try to wear protective clothing or equipment such as cooking gloves. Similarly, take care when using heat sources and make sure that children are kept away from dangerous areas when you are cooking.</p>
