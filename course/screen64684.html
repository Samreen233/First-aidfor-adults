			<h1>First Aid for Minor Burns</h1>
			<p>In this step, we’ll learn the key first aid techniques to use when someone experiences a minor burn or
				scald. A burn is considered minor when it is half the size of the victim’s hand.</p>
			<p>Minor burns that are no larger than half the size of a person's hand can usually be treated without the
				need for further medical attention. In fact, evidence shows that with immediate cooling, infection
				rates, pain levels, and the depth of a burn can be significantly reduced. It also reduces the need for
				admittance to a medical facility.

				How do we know when a burn is minor? The skin will appear red, hot, and swollen but not broken. This is
				important, as burns where the skin is broken are not minor and require further medical attention. This
				module only addresses first aid for minor burns. </p>
